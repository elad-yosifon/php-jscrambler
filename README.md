API
---
All of the API operations are wrapped in a static facade with the following properties/methods:

### Client
```php
require_once 'jscrambler.php';
$client = new JScramblerFacade::Client(array(
  "accessKey" => 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
  "secretKey" => 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
));
```

### downloadCode ($client, $projectId, $sourceId = null)
Downloads a project. It returns the content of a Zip file.
```php
JScramblerFacade::downloadCode($client, PROJECT_ID);
```

### getInfo ($client)
Gets information of all the client projects.
```php
JScramblerFacade::getInfo($client);
```

### pollProject ($client, $projectId)
Polls a project.
```php
JScramblerFacade::pollProject($client, PROJECT_ID);
```

### uploadCode ($client, $params)
Uploads a project. The generated project id can be found in the response.
```php
JScramblerFacade::uploadCode($client, array(
  "files" => array(
    "index.js",
    "lib/app.js"
  ),
  "domain_lock" => array(
    "*.jscrambler.com",
    "localhost"
  ),
  "rename_local" => true,
  "string_splitting" => array(
    "probability" => 0.3,
    "frequency" => 0.4
  ),
  "whitespace" => true
));
```

### deleteCode ($client, $projectId)
Deletes a project.
```php
JScramblerFacade::deleteCode($client, PROJECT_ID);
```

### process ($configPathOrObject)

```php
JScramblerFacade::process('config.json');
```
